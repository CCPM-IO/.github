# Welcome to CCPM-IO!

The [Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine - Informatics Operations (CCPM I/O)](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/ccpm/infrastructure) at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus aims to deliver reliable software and data to support CCPM clinical and research efforts while overseeing the development and implementation of informatics pipelines that process raw genotyping data. We also ensure that those pipelines accurately and reproducibly process genetic data for delivery into patientsâ€™ records for clinical care.

This GitHub Organization includes our software work towards the goals mentioned above.
